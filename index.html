	    					<h2>Africa Expedition Support</h2>
	    					<p>On our Luxury Flying Safaris, you can visit the most spectacular wildlife reserves, and some of the most incredible attractions Africa has to offer, in just a week. On longer flying tours, you’ll see even more: Victoria Falls, Masai Mara, and the blue waters and white sandy beaches of Zanzibar.</p>
	    					<p>Looking for a 4×4 overland tour of more than 7 weeks? Or a custom safari to countries that you choose? We do those, too! Charter a private tailor-made safari with us for as many weeks as you like to as many countries as you like!</p>

	    					<h2>Thailand Expedition</h2>
	    					<p>A Thailand expedition is a rich experience combining tours of grand palaces, serene temples, bustling markets and remote hill tribe villages with deep and remote jungle trekking, elephant riding and relaxing on picture perfect beaches. A school trip that is a true feast for the senses!</p>
	    					<p>Thailand forms the heart of South-East Asia, bordered by Malaysia to the south, Cambodia to the south-east and Myanmar (Burma) and Laos to the north. The topography varies from high mountains in the north, which are part of a series of ranges that extend across northern Myanmar to the south-eastern edges of the Tibet plateau, to tropical islands in the south that make up a portion of the Malay archipelago.</p>

	    					<h2>Rediscover North America</h2>
	    					<p>Once the drive to plan the trip was in place, our goal was to try and surpass the previous undertaking in both distance and duration. In order to do so, we decided to orient the trip south to north to maximize distance and utilize the seasons, but struggled to find exactly what we were looking for beginning at the U.S.-Canadian border. Honestly, we were kinda stuck. Until (yes, that proverbial ‘until’), the idea to start in the Gulf of Mexico was thrown into the mix, and we finally had a place to start. From there, we wove in popular route after popular route and connected the dots until we had our plan.</p>

	    					<h6>Rediscover North America canoe route</h6>
	    					<p>Last year, our readers were so impressed by the Trans-Territorial Canoe Expedition–a four-month, 2,600-mile canoe journey across Canada’s Northern Territories–that they voted it the Expedition of the Year at the 2013 C&K Awards. But for expedition-member Winchell Delano, crossing Canada’s far north from the Pacific Ocean to the Hudson Bay wasn’t enough. He is planning to go even bigger in 2015.</p>

	    					<h6>Ideas for your students' expedition to Thailand</h6>
	    					<p>Thailand is still a developing country. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved with  schools, orphanages and local communities to help enrich the lives of those that need your help. Tasks may include teaching basic English, renovating a classroom or building a playground.</p>

	    					<h6>Top Attractions in Africa</h6>
	    					<p>The word "Africa" alone conjures up a vision of acacia dotted landscapes streching as far as the eye can see, covered with vast herds of elephants, giraffes and wildebeest. There is a history both natural and man-made, going back to the beginning of time.</p>

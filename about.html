	    		<h3>Photography with HDR</h3>
	    	</div>
	    	<section class="aboutIt">
				<p>The bad rap HDR gets, comes from the flood of HDR photos online which are way over-processed. The photographer either is trying to be artsy or just hasn’t learned how to control the HDR software, usually either Photomatix Pro or HDR Efex Pro. My first attempt at processing today’s photo came about during my “trying to be artsy” period. Last year, when I posted it online, it got up to a respectable 96.5 rating on 500px, and on Google plus it had 3000 views, 92 plus 1’s, and 9 shares and I was really happy with the image. That was then.</p>

				<p>Well, last September, my 99 year old Mom died and I began several months of re-assessment of my place and purpose. During this time I haven’t produced much art but I sure have been thinking about it a lot.</p>

				<h3>What Ansel Adams Taught Me</h3>

				<p>Back in the 1970’s and 80’s, I learned the fundamentals of fine art landscape photography. Ansel was actually doing HDR photography when he invented his Zone System and incorporated it into his darkroom workflow. You’ve seen  his most striking images with exquisite detail everywhere, clouds, cliffs, trees, and water. Today with digital HDR photography it’s now quite easy, under any lighting conditions, to get the same detail Ansel could coax out of a film and paper workflow.</p>

				<p>HDR Landscape photography today, with a digital workflow, can be very awesome much easier than back in the days of film cameras. Unfortunately, most times it’s not.  There are some contemporary landscape HDR photographers who get it right though.  I want to be one of those.</p>

				<p>My goal is more focused now than ever before. Building on my photographic roots. Shooting landscapes with black & white film, going for maximum depth of field, and evoking a unique sense of place and reality in my work. My goal now is to continue to use HDR to make picture perfect landscape photos.  What does that mean and what will I have to do differently?</p>

				<h3>Clouds & Sky in Landscape photography</h3>

				<p>We landscape photographers don’t shoot much when the sky is bald.  Even though it’s possible to use Photoshop to drop clouds into a photo, I don’t do that.  In fact, I pretty much stay away from Photoshop altogether.  My Perfect HDR Workflow is designed to completely eliminate the need for Photoshop so that beginners can learn to make stunning HDR without a lot of expense or a steep learning curve,  So, clouds, which are a hallmark of much of Ansel Adams work are very important and somewhat difficult, to get exactly right.  Looking at my previous work,  I noticed that my clouds could use improvement. Solving the cloud riddle, I figured, will level up my landscape photography at least a notch.</p>
